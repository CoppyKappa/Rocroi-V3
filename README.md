# Rocroi-V3

Good day to be alive isnt it? I seriously didnt thought i was going to update rocroi 1 year after its original launch! Woah we come a long way haha, on this github MD note i will be writing all the changes made to Rocroi in this update and BELIEVE me, **we have a lot to talk about** :) 

It isnt a secret that Rocroi, while being the first crafted mission scenario on age of empires iv, it isnt on its best shape and i think this is the update it needed. **Keep this in mind though** With the update im not planning on changing THAT much the original rocroi experience but grab the core, update it and make the overall experience better, there are a few of changes regarding gameplay, as well as balance as always.

Lets start shall we?

# Update Key-aspects

The update focuses on improving the experience of the player, and making the mod feel more modern and on date. The overall changes to the mod goes from:

**-Formation movement for AI player**

**-Reinforcement alert overhaul**

**-Story overhaul**

**-LOCBD titles or event cues removed**

**-intro overhaul**

**-addition of a cinematic outro**

**-Clarified objectives**

**-Dynamic pings, areas of highlight for the player to understand what he should do**

**-Map design changes**

**-Potential scar error fixes**

**-Optional cosmetic tuning pack**

**-Player3 (dummy) addition to make sure each wave its played as it should

**And More!**

Note here: We are not gonna explain every and each one of them, it isnt nesesary but! we are going to highlight the most important changes!

# Cinematic intro overhaul, Addition of Outro

I think we can all agree the cinematic intro of original rocroi was "bad" to say the least. It was the first ever cinematic done on an scripted map made by a modder and NOT relic, so yeah what was possible and what was not it was still being discovered, anyways i re-did the cinematic, it may be one of my best cinematics so far and it looks epic, i also made it yeah, its **skippable** thank me later hehe

I also added an outro! My second ever outro and i think this one is way better than the outro i did on my latest mod, The Siege of Breda.

# AI behaviour, Unit behaviour

Before the update, units, specially AI units moved across the map, attacked your units, and prepared their offenses without any kind of formation movement, this not only looked wacky, it affected the overall difficulty, pace and timing of each wave. So when i saw this on my latest play tests, i inmediatly knew that i needed to fix that up.

Enemy Units **now** move, attack and prepare using formation movement, making it look epic and really battle-ish, alongside this change, reinforcements of player1 also follow this same formation movement change and they will always move as they should (no more wacky one-army man moving on their own)

# Player 3 addition

Rocroi now follows my classic 2 player, 1 dummy style of maps (crusade, breda and now rocroi), the addition of an allied player can help into making units you cant control neither attack, and this helps A LOT on rocroi, since theres a lot of scripted movement and a lot of posibilities of breaking something, but thats over now with the addition of player3 :)
