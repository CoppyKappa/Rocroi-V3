# Rocroi-V3

Good day to be alive isnt it? I seriously didnt thought i was going to update rocroi 1 year after its original launch! Woah we come a long way haha, on this github MD note i will be writing all the changes made to Rocroi in this update and BELIEVE me, **we have a lot to talk about** :) 

It isnt a secret that Rocroi, while being the first crafted mission scenario on age of empires iv, it isnt on its best shape and i think this is the update it needed. **Keep this in mind though** With the update im not planning on changing THAT much the original rocroi experience but grab the core, update it and make the overall experience better, there are a few of changes regarding gameplay, as well as balance as always.

Lets start shall we?

# Update Key-aspects

The update focuses on improving the experience of the player, and making the mod feel more modern and on date. The overall changes to the mod goes from:

**-Formation movement for AI player**

**-Reinforcement alert overhaul**

**-Story overhaul**

**-LOCBD titles or event cues removed**

**-intro overhaul**

**-addition of a cinematic outro**

**-Clarified objectives**

**-Dynamic pings, areas of highlight for the player to understand what he should do**

**-Map design changes**

**-Potential scar error fixes**

**-Optional cosmetic tuning pack**

**-Player3 (dummy) addition to make sure each wave its played as it should

**And More!**

Note here: We are not gonna explain every and each one of them, it isnt nesesary but! we are going to highlight the most important changes!

# Cinematic intro overhaul, Addition of Outro

I think we can all agree the cinematic intro of original rocroi was "bad" to say the least. It was the first ever cinematic done on an scripted map made by a modder and NOT relic, so yeah what was possible and what was not it was still being discovered, anyways i re-did the cinematic, it may be one of my best cinematics so far and it looks epic, i also made it yeah, its **skippable** thank me later hehe

I also added an outro! My second ever outro and i think this one is way better than the outro i did on my latest mod, The Siege of Breda.

# AI behaviour, Unit behaviour

Before the update, units, specially AI units moved across the map, attacked your units, and prepared their offenses without any kind of formation movement, this not only looked wacky, it affected the overall difficulty, pace and timing of each wave. So when i saw this on my latest play tests, i inmediatly knew that i needed to fix that up.

Enemy Units **now** move, attack and prepare using formation movement, making it look epic and really battle-ish, alongside this change, reinforcements of player1 also follow this same formation movement change and they will always move as they should (no more wacky one-army man moving on their own)

# Player 3 addition

Rocroi now follows my classic 2 player, 1 dummy style of maps (crusade, breda and now rocroi), the addition of an allied player can help into making units you cant control neither attack, and this helps A LOT on rocroi, since theres a lot of scripted movement and a lot of posibilities of breaking something, but thats over now with the addition of player3 :) 

# Cosmetic Tuning Pack

If youre up to date in aoe4 crafted maps modding, then you will recognize "Blockade at salerno" or "The Siege of vienna" , both mods from the modder Foxplot. These crafted/scripted maps have something very unique in them and thats the addition of a tuning pack that serves a purpose in-game (maybe new units, cosmetic changes, etc...) 

Now on rocroi V3, i created an cosmetic tuning pack that changes the name of some units and also its looks, its not necesary to play and its just like "if you want do it, if you dont, then play like it was supposed to be in the first place"

The tuning pack **replaces two units** , the "Spearman" and the "Handcannoner". The changes to these units are the following :

- Spearman renamed to **Tercio Spearman**
- Handcanoneer renamed to **Arcabucero**
- Handcanoneer icon changed
- Handcanoneer **skin** changed
- Handcanoneer **weapon** changed, however it deals the same damage

# Warning Entries Change 

I think one of the best changes to this update and im not kidding is the reduced stuff on screen that you have to read, it makes it so better. Now everytime you start a wave a horn sound will start, instead of warning on screen that you have to read :) , when you complete a wave you will rewarded as well with a happy sound, instead of an eventcue text.

# Story Overhaul

This is one of the BEST changes and one of the key reasons i wanted to make the update on the first place, im soo exited to be able to finally write this, but first lets get to the main points of the story overhaul and what i did:

- Deleted the LOCBD entries before each dialogue
- Improved the pace of reading , pace of warnings
- Re-wrote the story
- Improved the grammar
- Made it more epic

If you want to see the direct comparison of the dialogues :
