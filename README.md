# Rocroi-V3

Good day to be alive isnt it? I seriously didnt thought i was going to update rocroi 1 year after its original launch! Woah we come a long way haha, on this github MD note i will be writing all the changes made to Rocroi in this update and BELIEVE me, **we have a lot to talk about** :) 

It isnt a secret that Rocroi, while being the first crafted mission scenario on age of empires iv, it isnt on its best shape and i think this is the update it needed. **Keep this in mind though** With the update im not planning on changing THAT much the original rocroi experience but grab the core, update it and make the overall experience better, there are a few of changes regarding gameplay, as well as balance as always.

Lets start shall we?
